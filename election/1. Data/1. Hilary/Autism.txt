Supporting families impacted by autism. 
We have to do more to support the millions of Americans with autism and their families. 
	•	 
	•	 Conduct a nationwide early screening outreach campaign to ensure that all children can get screened—especially those from underserved backgrounds. 
	•	Push states to require health insurance coverage for autism services in both private insurance and marketplace plans. 
	•	Support adults on the autism spectrum by connecting them with employment opportunities and authorizing the first-ever adult autism prevalence study.  

“Too many American families are staying up at night worrying about their family members, especially children, who are living with autism. There is more we can do.”
HILLARY, JANUARY 5, 2016 
More than 3.5 million Americans are believed to have autism spectrum disorder (ASD)—including an estimated one in every 68 children. And the cost of treatment and services is more than most families can afford. Improving support for children and adults with autism can vastly improve their lives and make the cost more sustainable for families, as well as for Medicaid and other public programs. 
Hillary Clinton is proposing a new, wide-ranging autism initiative that will:  
	•	Expand insurance coverage for autism services. When autism services aren’t covered by insurance, they are unaffordable for many families. Hillary will push states to require health insurance coverage for autism services—both behavioral and developmental—in private insurance plans and those offered through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. 
	•	Conduct a nationwide early screening outreach campaign. Children as young as two years old can show signs of autism, but many aren’t diagnosed until months or even years later. Studies suggest that children who are African American, Latino, or female are especially likely to receive late diagnoses, as early signs get missed. Hillary’s plan would help ensure that all children, and in particular children from underserved backgrounds, can get screened for autism. 
	•	Invest in more research to deepen our understanding of autism. We need more research to better understand child brain development and the genetic linkages for autism, create better diagnostic tools, and improve treatments and services for people on the autism spectrum and their families at every stage of life. Hillary will significantly increase government investment in autism-related research, from studies that improve patient services to research that identifies more genetic markers. She will also call for the first-ever study on the prevalence of adults on the autism spectrum. 
	•	Increase employment opportunities for individuals with autism. Fewer than half of youth with autism are employed or pursuing higher education in the two years after they graduate from high school. Hillary will launch the Autism Works Initiative to increase resources and establish public-private partnerships to help students with autism establish a post-graduation transition plan and to connect adults with autism to new employment opportunities. 
	•	Keep students with autism safe at school. Students with autism are particularly vulnerable to bullying, abuse, and injury at school. As president, Hillary will enact the Keeping All Students Safe Act and other reforms to protect children with autism from abuse in their schools. She will also toughen the U.S. Department of Education guidance on bullying to protect children with autism from harassment. 
Hillary has a long record of advocating for children and families affected by autism, describing it in 2007 as “one of the most urgent—and least understood—challenges facing our children.” As first lady, she fought hard for more awareness and funding for autism, including supporting the bipartisan Children’s Health Act of 2000, which had a special focus on autism research. In the Senate, she introduced the bipartisan Expanding the Promise for Individuals with Autism Act (EPIAA) to expand access to interventions and support for Americans with autism. And she cosponsored legislation in 2006 that authorized hundreds of millions of dollars in new spending on autism-related programs, including research, education, early detection, and intervention.
