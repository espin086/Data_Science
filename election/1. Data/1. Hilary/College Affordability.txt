Making college affordable and taking on student debt 
The New College Compact: 
Costs won’t be a barrier, debt won’t hold you back.
Hillary will:
	•	Give every student the option to graduate from a public college or university in their state without taking on any student debt. 
	•	Enable Americans with existing student loan debt to refinance at current rates. 
	•	Hold colleges and universities accountable for controlling costs and making tuition affordable. 
“We need to make a quality education affordable and available to everyone willing to work for it, without saddling them with decades of debt.”
HILLARY, AUGUST 10, 2015 


Hillary has a vision for America in which education is attainable for all. The New College Compact will ensure that costs aren’t a barrier to college and that debt doesn’t hold Americans back.  Here’s what every student and family should expect under Hillary’s plan:   
Costs won't be a barrier.
	•	Every student should have the option to graduate from a public college or university in their state without taking on any student debt. Under Hillary’s plan, by 2021, families with income up to $125,000 will pay no tuition at in-state four-year public colleges and universities—covering more than 80 percent of all families. And from the start of the plan, every student from a family making $85,000 a year or less will be able to go to an in-state four-year public college or university without paying tuition. Students at community college will also pay no tuition. 
	•	Hillary will also restore year-round Pell Grant funding, so low- and middle-income students have the support they need to take the classes that will put them on the path to graduation throughout the year. 
	•	Students will do their part by contributing their earnings from working 10 hours a week. 
	•	Families will do their part by making an affordable and realistic family contribution. 
	•	The federal government will make a major investment in the New College Compact by providing grants to states that commit to these goals, and by cutting interest rates on loans. 
	•	States will have to step up and meet their obligation to invest in higher education by maintaining current levels of higher education funding and reinvesting over time. 
	•	Colleges and universities will be accountable for improving outcomes and controlling costs to ensure that tuition is affordable and that students who invest in college leave with a degree. 
	•	We will encourage innovators who design imaginative new ways of providing a valuable college education to students—while cracking down on abusive practices that burden students with debt without value. 
	•	A $25 billion fund will support HBCUs, HSIs, and other MSIs serving a high percentage of Pell Grant recipients to help lower the cost of attendance and improve student outcomes at low-cost, modest-endowment nonprofit private schools. 

Debt won’t hold you back.
	•	Under Hillary’s plan, if you have student debt, you will be able to refinance your loans at current rates. An estimated 25 million borrowers will receive debt relief, and the typical borrower could save $2,000 over the life of his or her loans. 
	•	For future undergraduates, the plan will significantly cut interest rates so they reflect the government’s low cost of debt. This could save students hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of their loans. 
	•	Everyone will be able to enroll in a simplified, income-based repayment program so that borrowers never have to pay more than 10 percent of what they make. 
	•	Employers will be encouraged to contribute too. Hillary will create a payroll deduction portal for employers and employees to simplify the repayment process—and explore more options to encourage employers to help pay down student debt. 
	•	Hillary will take immediate executive action to offer a three-month moratorium on student loan payments to all federal loan borrowers. That will give every borrower a chance to consolidate their loans, sign up for income-based repayment plans, and take advantage of opportunities to reduce their monthly interest payments and fees. And if a borrower is delinquent or in default, they’ll receive additional options to help get back on their feet.
