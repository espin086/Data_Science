Immigration reform 
America needs comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship. 

	•	Enact comprehensive immigration reform to create a pathway to citizenship, keep families together, and enable millions of workers to come out of the shadows. 
	•	Defend President Obama’s executive actions to provide deportation relief for DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents, and extend those actions to additional persons with sympathetic cases if Congress refuses to act. 
	•	Promote naturalization and support immigrant integration. 
	•	End family detention and close private immigrant detention centers. 
“We have to finally and once and for all fix our immigration system—this is a family issue. It’s an economic issue too, but it is at heart a family issue. If we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it’s the right thing to do—and it is—but because it will strengthen families, strengthen our economy, and strengthen our country. That’s why we can’t wait any longer, we can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship.”
HILLARY, MAY 5, 2015 




Hillary has shown longstanding, steadfast commitment to America’s immigrants throughout her career. As president, she will work to ensure a fair and just immigration system.  Since the founding of this nation, generations of immigrants have contributed to the strength of America. Immigrants have spurred economic growth, fueled innovation, defended us abroad and added to the unique character of our nation. Despite the steady growth of America’s immigrant population, immigrants continue to earn less, lag on educational attainment rates, and face discrimination. And, while millions of undocumented immigrants have become an integral part of America’s social fabric, many live in fear that deportation will tear their families apart.   Hillary is fighting for an America where every family feels like they belong here. Instead of breaking up hardworking, law-abiding immigrant families who have enriched America for years, she will work to keep families together and ensure a more humane immigration enforcement system.
As president, Hillary will:
	•	Fight for comprehensive immigration reform legislation with a path to full and equal citizenship. As senator, Hillary was a strong supporter of comprehensive immigration reform, cosponsoring Senator Ted Kennedy’s 2004 bill and supporting the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act in 2006 and 2007. She co-sponsored the DREAM Act in the Senate in 2003, 2005, and 2007 to give undocumented students who grew up in the U.S. a chance to contribute to our nation’s growth. As president, Hillary will fight for comprehensive immigration reform that provides a full and equal path to citizenship, treats every person with dignity, upholds the rule of law, protects our borders and national security, and brings millions of hardworking people into the formal economy. 
	•	Defend President Obama’s DACA and DAPA executive actions. President Obama’s executive actions that provide relief from deportation for DREAMers and parents of Americans and lawful residents would protect an estimated 5 million people. Hillary will defend DACA and DAPA against partisan attacks and politically motivated lawsuits that would put DREAMers and others at risk of deportation. 
	•	Do everything possible under the law to go further to protect families. If Congress continues its refusal to act on comprehensive immigration reform, Hillary will put in place a simple, straightforward, accessible system for parents of DREAMers and others with a history of service and contribution to their communities to be able to make their case and be eligible for deferred action as well. 
	•	End the 3- and 10-year bars. Current immigration law forces families—especially those whose members have different citizenship or immigration statuses—into a heartbreaking dilemma: pursue a green card by leaving the country and your loved ones behind, or remain in the shadows. Hillary will call on Congress to repeal the 3- and 10-year bars to keep families together. 
	•	Promote naturalization. There are an estimated 9 million lawful permanent residents (green card holders) in the United States who are eligible to become U.S. citizens. Hillary believes we need to do more to help the millions of people who are eligible for citizenship to take that last step. She will work to expand fee waivers so more people can get a break on costs, increase access to robust language programs to help people boost their English proficiency, and enhance outreach and education so more people are informed about their options and engaged in the process. 
	•	Support immigrant integration. The United States is home to an estimated 42 million immigrants—13% of the overall U.S. population. But in too many communities, immigrants still face significant language, education, and economic barriers that prevent them from fully participating in their new home. Hillary will work to break down these barriers and support successful immigrant integration. 
	◦	Create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs to ensure successful immigrant and refugee integration in every community. Given the cross-cutting nature of immigrant integration policy concerns, Hillary believes it is critical that there be a proactive effort to coordinate policies and programs across federal agencies and with state and local governments. In 2014, the Obama Administration announced a task force to study integration services and make recommendations for improvements. Hillary would work to implement the task force’s recommendations and create the first ever federal Office of Immigrant Affairs to ensure there is a dedicated place in the White House where integration policies and services for immigrants and refugees are managed. 
	◦	Support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding for community navigators and similar organizations. Immigrant integration starts at the local level where volunteers, community-based organizations, and legal services providers are often the first people to welcome immigrants into their new communities and help them get settled. Hillary would create a new competitive grant program to supplement current funding streams for integration and naturalization services, focusing on building the capacity of organizations in the field. By investing in efforts like the Community Navigator model developed by the National Partnership for New Americans, Hillary will ensure that more immigrants can receive the support they need to apply for naturalization or DAPA and DACA, seek out education and workforce training, and navigate their new communities. 
	◦	Significantly increase federal resources for adult English language education and citizenship education. English proficiency is essential to social and economic mobility in the United States. But for too many immigrants, accessing affordable and effective English language learning resources continues to be a struggle. Of the roughly 23 million adults 16 and over in the country who have limited English proficiency, fewer than 1 million benefit from the primary federal-state partnership program for providing adult English instruction. As senator, Hillary introduced the Strengthening Communities through English and Integration Act, which proposed increased investments in integration resources, with a special focus on English and civics programs. As president, Hillary will greatly expand the federal resources devoted to adult English language education and citizenship education—ensuring that immigrants, citizenship applicants, parents of young children, and others can access the programming they need, whether at community organizations, public libraries, adult schools, community colleges or through new innovative platforms. 
	•	Expand access to affordable health care to all families. Hillary has been fighting her entire life to ensure that families have access to affordable health care. She sponsored the Immigrant Children’s Health Improvement Act in the Senate, which later became law and allows immigrant children and pregnant women to obtain Medicaid and SCHIP. She believes we should let families—regardless of immigration status—buy into the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Families who want to purchase health insurance should be able to do so. 
	•	Conduct humane, targeted immigration enforcement. Hillary believes immigration enforcement must be humane, targeted, and effective. She will focus enforcement resources on detaining and deporting those individuals who pose a violent threat to public safety, and work to ensure refugees who seek asylum in the U.S. have a fair chance to tell their stories. 
	◦	End family detention. Hillary believes we should end family detention for parents and children who arrive at our border in desperate situations. We have alternatives to detention for those who pose no flight or public safety risk, such as supervised release, that have proved effective and cost a fraction of what it takes to keep families in detention. 
	◦	Close private immigrant detention centers. Hillary will end private immigrant detention centers. She believes we should move away from contracting out this critical government function to private corporations and private industry incentives that may contribute—or have the appearance of contributing—to over-incarceration.
