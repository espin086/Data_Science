Voting rights 
We should be making it easier to vote, not harder. 

	•	Restore the crucial provisions of the Voting Rights Act. 
	•	Implement universal, automatic voter registration for eligible 18-year-olds. 
	•	Set a new national standard allowing early voting to begin 20 days or more before an election. 
“Yes, this is about democracy. But it’s also about dignity—about the ability to stand up and say, ‘Yes, I am a citizen. I am an American. My voice counts.’ And no matter where you come from or what you look like or how much money you have, that means something. … In fact, it means a lot.”
HILLARY, JUNE 4, 2015 




Hillary has laid out her vision for how to expand access to the ballot box for all Americans and how to defend against the systematic, deliberate efforts to stop millions of citizens from participating in our democracy:
	•	Repairing the Voting Rights Act. Congress should move quickly to pass legislation that would fix the damage done to the Voting Rights Act by the Supreme Court and restore the full protections American voters need and deserve. These protections are crucial for young and minority voters, seniors, and other underrepresented groups disproportionately affected by harmful Republican efforts to restrict voting. 
	•	Setting a new national standard for early voting. It’s time to set a standard across our country of at least 20 days of early in-person voting, including opportunities for evening and weekend voting. This will reduce long lines and give more people an opportunity to vote, especially those who have work or family obligations during the day. Early in-person voting isn’t just convenient—it’s also more secure, more reliable, and more affordable than absentee voting. 
	•	Implementing universal, automatic voter registration. Every citizen in every state should be automatically registered to vote when they turn 18, unless they choose to opt out. At the same time, we need to make sure that registration rolls are secure, up to date, and accurate. When you move, your registration should move with you. Modernizing registration will add tens of millions of voters to the rolls, cost less, and reduce the potential for errors or irregularities.
